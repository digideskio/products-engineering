## Pull requests

We love pull requests and merging code from the community! We will thoughtfully review your code and work with you to get it primed and ready for release.  There are a few things that are worth knowing about that process:

1. **Please fork the `develop` and submit your pull requests against that branch.** This is the branch with the latest code we are working on. Pull requests to the master branch can't be merged automatically and may be closed.

2. **We love details!** When submitting pull requests, be as detailed as you can in describing what you are fixing and why - it will help expedite the review process!

3. **Don't be scared of our friendly tr1b0t!** We use a bot to codesniff pull requests and alert Modern Tribe developers when we need to create/associate the PR with a ticket in our internal ticket tracking system. Feel free to fix codesniffer issues, but don't sweat the ticket notice :)

4. **When developing apply `define('SCRIPT_DEBUG', true)` in your wp-config.php**. This will load unminified versions of our js assets and give you some debugging information in your dev console.

5. **Familiarize yourself with the dev folder, its readme and run the appropriate Grunt tasks before committing**. JS minification, CSS minification, debug code removal, linting and more should be performed as you develop. Its all done with the grunt tasks defined in the dev folder.

## Some other items of note

1. **Please submit support issues and bug reports to designated locations.** Bug reports can be made at [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/the-events-calendar). If you have purchased any of our premium add-ons, you may create an account and submit support requests in our [Support Forums](http://m.tri.be/kj).

2. **Lastly: We don't recommend using the develop branch on production sites!** You’re welcome to give it a shot, but it is totally unrecommended - and we cannot provide any support if things go wrong. You’re on your own if you run develop code on your site.

That's all! please have fun and code responsibly :)
